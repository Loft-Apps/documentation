# Navigate

The "Navigate" menu item on the sidebar opens up to the root folder of the currently selected sandbox.

The navigate allows you to navigate the local sandbox.  It is presented as directory structure

Assets can be located anywhere in the folder structure.  Any folder can be designated as a Loft Asset.  When a new asset has been created, the user can then start to commit files into this asset.

The navigate folder view looks a lot like what you would find in Windows Explorer or OSX Finder.  Each file will have a simple file icon and regular folders will have a file icon.  However, whenever a folder is a Loft Asset, Loft will display the preview of the asset with some special buttons on the right to interact with those assets.
