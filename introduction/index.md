## What is Loft?

Loft manages assets.


## Why Loft?

### Too Many Files
There are just too many files.  Working at the file level is acceptable when updating a particular character or prop.  You create the files you need and make sure the dependencies work.  However, when this is scaled up to the entire project, the sheer number of files results in deeply nested folder structures in an attempt to organize the chaos.  In order to find anything, folders are used for searching tags and you end up with even further nesting of folders. 

Navigating this folder structure, looking for something becomes overwhelmingly time consuming and users end up spending enormous amounts of valuable time navigating these structures for find what they are looking for.







### Searching ...
The fundamental problem with searching through a file base system is that there are just too many positive matches when the number of files becomes too large.  Since all the data is embedded in the directory structure of the file system,  it rapidly leads to deeply nested folder structures that attempt to as people try to organize the files in some meaningful structure. 

This makes it next to impossible to find anything because there are just way too many files in a system that has only folders and file names to give context for a search.  File searching through typical Windows Explorer or OSX Finder may be familiar but scale poorly for searching.  

Any attempt to use searches of the file views results in a huge list of false positives.  And the results returned are a list of files, making it extremely unlikely to find the particular files.  With the results returned, there is very little context to these files except for folders they exist in. With a near useless search result, users end up navigating the folder structure, as painful as that is.

The end result is a lot of wasted time spent just looking for stuff.




### Syncing
With an SCM, in order to get a particular version of an asset, you have to sync to a branch.  If you just want to work on a single asset, you have to check-out the entire branch which can involve an enormous number of files.

This works fine for source code as even large code bases result in relatively small footprints when compared with digital productions.
