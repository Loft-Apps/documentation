# Key Benefits of Loft

## User Focused

Loft is primarily a user focused experience.  It brings the often technical and complicated mechanisms of Real time production asset management under control of the end users who have to work with it every day.  This means focusing on the user workflows ensuring that the primary integration is with people.

Current asset management tools focus on the technology.  And this shows in the interfaces that are primarily used for digital production. 

Manage Assets, not just Files
Loft brings production asset management to end users by fundamentally managing assets.  This is in contrast to all SCMs which manage files.


What is the difference between a file and an asset?  A file as everyone knows, is a bundle of data on a drive pointed to by a directory and name.  An asset is an entity that contains all the information about that entity: keywords, tasks, other assets, and also, files.

## Searching
When content creators search for something, they think of a character, a prop, a vehicle.  They do not think of a particular file.  

Doing a search on the file system results in endless lists of junk that will match.  They are not targeted searches on keywords or data.  There is no context to search for the file outside of its folder structure and the name of the file.  This results in an unworkable number of false positive results.

And the results of the search are a list of files.  If the file happens to be a .uasset file, there is no ;way to see what it looks like unless it is opened in the Unreal editor.  With Loft, the search is for assets and a list of assets are returned.  The asset will contain a preview.  It will also contain context for this asset.  Where was it used?  What supporting files are there?  Reference files?  Similar but alternative assets to use?  Notes?  All of this supporting data and files are not searched upon.  It is the asset.  This significantly reduces the number of garbage files that come up in a search.

Searches are far more targeted.  Results are far more relevant.  Time is far less wasted.  Tempers are far more in control.

Studies have shown that successful searches result in 23% less broken screens.  18% less smashed mice and a whopping XX% more productivity.  OK, the first two numbers are made up, but you get the idea.
