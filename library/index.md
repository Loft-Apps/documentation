# Asset Library

The asset library is the central remote repository for the assets. It displays as searchable list of assets that have been pushed to the server for others in the project to download and use.


## Searching Assets


## Downloading Assets


Clicking on the downdload icon on the right of the asset will commence the download process.  Loft will download the asset to the local sandbox in the appropriate folder location for that asset.  It will be downloadd in the background, so you can continue to work, including search for other assets to download or working on assets that have been downloaded.
